The goal is for any page\u2014no matter how small or experimental\u2014to live somewhere findable and contextualized, now and in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\udde0 Navigation + Storytelling Strategy Now Locked\\r\\n\\r\\nToday I finalized the plan for the site\'s core storytelling and navigational experience. It\'s composed of three main pillars:\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83c\udfe0 Homepage as Mission Control  \\r\\nThe homepage will serve as the primary navigational hub\u2014not a dashboard with live updates, but a structured, intentional map of the site. It will orient new users, direct followers to the leading edge of the narrative, and organize all categories and tools for me as creator.\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83e\uddf5 Chronological Narrative Timeline  \\r\\nThis is the backbone of the story. A long-form narrative log of the entire project\u2019s evolution\u2014milestones, pivots, progress, and reflections\u2014each with links to the logs, research, or documents they connect to.\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83e\udded Start Here Page  \\r\\nAn onboarding document that teaches newcomers how to understand and use the site. It includes explanations of folders, tags, log types, naming conventions, and where to jump in based on interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\u2019m locking in this plan going forward. These three elements will be the permanent triad that guides site structure from here out. The [Website Navigation Plan](/docs/system/website/navigation-system-plan) document has all the specifics.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\uddea Personal Reflection\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\u2019s a strange satisfaction in doing all this. It feels like world-building\u2014not in a fictional sense, but in an infrastructural one. I\u2019m setting up the scaffolding for a world I haven\u2019t fully built yet, and that\u2019s exciting. It makes it easier to imagine what this place could grow into.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce this groundwork is stable, it will allow everything else\u2014fiction, logs, systems, experiments\u2014to evolve organically without collapsing under their own weight.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udd2e What\u2019s Next\\r\\n\\r\\n- Finalize homepage layout (design + content)\\r\\n- Draft the narrative timeline structure and initial entries\\r\\n- Build out the Start Here page\\r\\n- Complete the tag index system\\r\\n- Write the \u201cDocument Your Own Rules\u201d page with conventions and style guides\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site is just about ready to support its own evolution. From here on out, it\u2019s all about populating the structure and letting the story breathe."},{"id":"logs/daily/2025-04-01-second-log","metadata":{"permalink":"/buds_bunker/logs/logs/daily/2025-04-01-second-log","editUrl":"https://github.com/doubleobud/buds_bunker/tree/main/logs/daily/2025-04-01-second-log.md","source":"@site/logs/daily/2025-04-01-second-log.md","title":"Second Log \u2013 Building the Foundation","description":"Planning out the website infrastructure to support future creative and technical development.","date":"2025-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"devlog","permalink":"/buds_bunker/logs/tags/devlog"},{"inline":true,"label":"planning","permalink":"/buds_bunker/logs/tags/planning"},{"inline":true,"label":"infrastructure","permalink":"/buds_bunker/logs/tags/infrastructure"}],"readingTime":3.33,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Joe Ault","title":"Bunker Operator","url":"https://github.com/doubleobud","page":null,"imageURL":"https://github.com/doubleobud.png","key":"doubleobud"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Second Log \u2013 Building the Foundation","description":"Planning out the website infrastructure to support future creative and technical development.","date":"2025-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["doubleobud"],"tags":["devlog","planning","infrastructure"],"slug":"logs/daily/2025-04-01-second-log"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Third Log \u2013 Continue Website Foundation","permalink":"/buds_bunker/logs/logs/daily/2025-04-02-third-log"},"nextItem":{"title":"First Log \u2013 Kickoff","permalink":"/buds_bunker/logs/logs/daily/2025-03-31-first-log"}},"content":"I want to jump right into making sure this website is safe and secure.

Systems like the to-do list and document repository should be established early and designed to extend easily.\\r\\n- **b.** I want to avoid early mistakes that I\'ll deeply regret later.\\r\\n- **c.** I should borrow ideas from both **Confluence** and **Jira**, which I\u2019ve used before.\\r\\n- **d.** I don\u2019t need to develop anything *for the universe itself* right now\u2014this is about foundational systems.\\r\\n- **e.** I should start a section for **notes and instructional materials** inside the docs. It needs to be efficient and integrated with templates. There should be an entire section dedicated to notes on how to make this website function.\\r\\n- **f.** What other *fundamental* website features should I implement now? Anything that would support *visitors* early on? Not sure.\\r\\n- **g.** What needs cleaning up in what I\u2019ve already done? I think my folder structure and naming conventions are a bit messy.\\r\\n- **h.** What should I be aware of now that will help me later?\\r\\n- **i.** This site will soon begin documenting my research and development process, eventually leading to actual production. Is there anything I should be planning for *now* that relates to that?\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\udd16 Prompt for AI Support\\r\\n\\r\\n> See my stream-of-consciousness thoughts above on where I want the website to go next.  \\r\\n> \\r\\n> You also have some context documents for background, though let\u2019s prioritize my comments in this log.  \\r\\n> \\r\\n> Try to address each of my points using best practices and relevant examples while meeting my unique needs. Also, please look out for things I might not know\u2014I\u2019m very much a novice with major knowledge gaps.

A lot of my process is homegrown and I\u2019m probably not getting the best results yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f Break Time\\r\\n\\r\\nHeading off to work out.
