I think this is just not only links and tagging, but I should add in a TOC, index, tag index/databases etc. This would make the site navigable right from the beginning with every document indexed somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have significantly developed the plan now. I\u2019m building out the core navigation and storytelling framework for the site\u2014starting with a mission-control-style homepage, a chronological narrative timeline, and a streamlined \u201cStart Here\u201d guide. The goal is to make everything linkable, discoverable, and future-proof while capturing the story of this project as it unfolds.

Systems like the to-do list and document repository should be established early and designed to extend easily.\\r\\n- **b.** I want to avoid early mistakes that I\'ll deeply regret later.\\r\\n- **c.** I should borrow ideas from both **Confluence** and **Jira**, which I\u2019ve used before.\\r\\n- **d.** I don\u2019t need to develop anything *for the universe itself* right now\u2014this is about foundational systems.\\r\\n- **e.** I should start a section for **notes and instructional materials** inside the docs. It needs to be efficient and integrated with templates. There should be an entire section dedicated to notes on how to make this website function.\\r\\n- **f.** What other *fundamental* website features should I implement now? Anything that would support *visitors* early on? Not sure.\\r\\n- **g.** What needs cleaning up in what I\u2019ve already done? I think my folder structure and naming conventions are a bit messy.\\r\\n- **h.** What should I be aware of now that will help me later?\\r\\n- **i.** This site will soon begin documenting my research and development process, eventually leading to actual production. Is there anything I should be planning for *now* that relates to that?\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\udd16 Prompt for AI Support\\r\\n\\r\\n> See my stream-of-consciousness thoughts above on where I want the website to go next.  \\r\\n> \\r\\n> You also have some context documents for background, though let\u2019s prioritize my comments in this log.  \\r\\n> \\r\\n> Try to address each of my points using best practices and relevant examples while meeting my unique needs.
