Writing this first post put me in a kind of agony, and I want to explain why.

I had to build this website and figure out how you were going to interact with it, when all I really wanted to do was start from a fundamental philosophical place—something about how I use my time—and build my way into… something. I don’t even want to say a “project,” because that already feels too defined. Truth is, I’m not even sure what to call it yet.

But I did know one thing from the beginning: whatever it was going to be, I wanted to document it. I wanted to share it. I knew that sounded kind of ungrounded, maybe even a little absurd, but that’s truly where I was standing. I wanted to start from a point zero, build forward step by step, and have people coming along—not just as readers, but as participants, with some kind of profile system or character system or… whatever this turns into.

That’s where the conundrum comes in.

I’d honestly rather hit you with a long chain of writings, all stacked in sequence, building to the point where it finally makes sense to start talking about things like website development, or how you interact with the site. But I didn’t want to hide all of that until later. I wanted you here from the beginning. Right at ground zero.

So now I’m in this weird crunch—trying to figure out how to line up the writing with the site structure, without breaking either of them. I don’t know if I’ll get it right on the first try. But I figured it was worth saying up front.

So you clicked on this post in the Origin Timeline—thank you—and here’s what I’m actually trying to do with it.

Like I said, there’s not just one thread here. There are multiple tracks happening at the same time, and I needed a format that could hold that. That’s where the card system on the timeline comes in. You’ll be able to move down each track at your own pace, in whatever order makes sense to you.

One of the threads will focus on the **philosophical origin** of all this—the deeper, slower stuff that tries to understand where this whole idea even came from. Another thread jumps straight into the **website itself**—what decisions shaped it, how the technical side evolved, and what’s relevant to the user experience right now. You’ll even get to watch the site get built in real time, assuming you're here early enough.

But I also want to jump immediately into **user interaction**, especially the parts related to **character development** and your **profile**. That can’t wait. As I mentioned above, I’m not holding off on the philosophical stuff—that’s going to feed right into this—but I want the interactive layer to start growing right away too.

We’ll be starting with some very **primitive mechanics**—basic concepts, simple structure—but the idea is to do it in a way that’s *extensible*. Something foundational we can build on, rather than something we constantly have to rip apart and redo. Still, I expect we’ll make some early mistakes. I’m okay with that. The important thing is to just get going. I’ll make sure anything we change later makes sense, and that your progress isn’t lost along the way.

So that’s the second big character here: you.  
You’ll be shaping this space alongside me from the very beginning.  
I’ll let you catch up here—and then I’ll keep going.

There’s another part that feels a little out of place but has to start now, whether I like it or not.

This site is going live pretty early. And it’s going to involve a **lot of writing**. Ideally, writing would’ve emerged naturally later on, as just one part of whatever this whole thing turns out to be—maybe not even as its own focus, just something that developed along the way. Then I could’ve slotted in all the structure behind it—**the research, the best practices, the training, the hours of practice**—*after* writing had proven itself necessary.

But here we are. The writing has already begun. You’re engaging with it now. So I’m going to treat this as my starting point too—not just for you, but for me. I’ll try to improve from here, starting with the fundamentals, just like I’m doing in every other part of this.

So for now, I think there are four main tracks you’ll be able to engage with on the site:

1. **Philosophical Origins** – What we’re even doing here and what it means to begin something like this from zero.  
2. **Website Development** – How the technical side of the site was built, changed, and how it will evolve alongside everything else.  
3. **Character & Interaction Design** – How your presence here becomes a profile, and eventually, a character—something that grows as the world does.  
4. **Writing as Practice** – A thread focused on improving writing itself—starting raw and early, then slowly layering in tools, skill, and structure.

Each track will have its own interactive layer. There’ll be small tasks, chances to prove you’re following along, ways to shape your character and leave a trail behind you. Nothing major yet, just little pieces that will start to build into something over time.

So we need to get started—right away—with the things I’ve been talking about.

Here’s how it’s going to work for now: **every time you click on a post**, you’ll earn what I’m calling (for now) **one token**. Tokens are your basic currency here. You’ll use them to interact with the site, unlock new content, and eventually shape your character.

Right now, this site is still missing a few key pieces you’re going to need just to really use it. So we’re starting simple. You earned **one token** for opening this post. Down below, you’ll find a small question about what you’ve just read—answer it and you’ll earn more tokens. At the bottom of the page, you’ll see **two ways to spend them**. And just like that, the interaction begins.

You can always head back to the **Origin Timeline** to see where you want to go next. That’s your current hub. Within each card, you’ll be able to spend tokens, unlock new branches, and gradually develop your character by engaging with the ideas across the four tracks I mentioned above.

Eventually, the timeline will give way to something more complex—a full system of paths, decisions, and interactions that open up as the world builds. That’s when we’ll start shifting toward a **dashboard-style experience**. But for now, you’re here at the beginning, and the only way forward is step by step.
