## Where We Begin

On the Start Here page, two axiomatic claims were introduced:

- You know you are alive.  
- You know your time is passing, leading to your death.

These are not speculative theories. They are the most basic conditions of experience.  
From them arises the guiding question of this entire project:

> What can a person do with their time while they are alive?

Before we can even begin to answer that question, we first need to evaluate these axioms to see if they are something we can believe to be true with confidence—before we attempt to build upon them.

## You Know You Are Alive

Connecting the certainty that *something is being experienced* to the statement *you know you are alive* is not as simple as it sounds.  
We begin not with assumptions, but with what cannot be denied—and carefully build from there.  
From the raw presence of experience, we trace the first logical steps that lead to selfhood, change, and the foundation of a life.


### A. Something is Being Experienced

There is one undeniable fact that stands at the beginning of all inquiry: the presence of experience itself.  
Even if every perception, thought, or belief you hold turns out to be uncertain, experience remains undeniable.  
The very act of questioning or doubting is itself evidence of experience.  
Philosophers call this foundational certainty “phenomenal consciousness.”  
Experience itself is immediately and unmistakably given.  
This is not an assumption nor a belief.  
It is the irreducible foundation from which all other questions must be asked.

### B. Experience Implies an Experiencing Point of View

For an experience to occur, it must appear somewhere.  
It cannot exist independently, floating without context.  
Experience is always received through a frame of reference.  
That frame is a central perspective from which sensations, feelings, and thoughts are channeled.  
Cognitive scientists call this the “subjective point of view.”  
It does not imply an elaborate personal identity or narrative.  
It simply marks the center of awareness.

### C. A Point of View Implies a Self and a Not-Self

Your existence does indeed seem self-evident in the purest sense, as Descartes showed us.  
However, where does you stop and other begin?  
How do you know you are an individual?

You being a "you" is not a metaphysical given—and it never can be.  
But we do have a great deal of experience suggesting there is, in fact, a distinction between "me" and "not-me."

You experience this every day.  
The brain organizes perception as if there is a single, unified self.  
You create a narrative from memories and experiences that forms your sense of "self."  
This is further reinforced by the obvious bodily boundary you experience in every waking moment.  
You cannot directly control others, and they cannot directly control you.  
In fact, no one else can access your point of view.  
And society gives you consistent feedback that you are a distinct, coherent person.

We are not claiming to know exactly where the boundary between "you" and "not-you" begins or ends.  
But we can safely say such a boundary does exist, in different ways depending on the context.  
That is enough to move forward—while noting that further exploration may be warranted later.

## Claim Reading Reward

Every time you read a section of a post, you get rewarded for your effort with we will start out calling a token. These tokens can be spend to perform various actions on the site. You will see this button reguarly as you read.

<ClaimTokenButton />

## Question Bank

This "Question Bank" module is also one we will use often to shape your profile. This information is recorded and added to your profile page. Later I will explain in more detail who characterization works.

<QuestionBlock
  questionKey="existence_self"
  text="Do you exist as a self?"
/>

## Unlocked Upgrades

I have many times of interactions planned for this experience, and allowing you to upgrade your profile is one of them. For now we do not have much to present, but if you exist as a self, you deserve a proper name. Spend one token to name yourself. You also gained a token for answering a question. Spend both now as you need to unlock the navbar if you want to access your account or log-off. 

CHARACTER NAMING UPGRADE (GPT-This button should unlock the function of character naming on the profile page rather than naming here. There should be a message after buying the upgrade to see the profile page etc.)

NAVBAR BANNER UPGRADE (GPT-This will unlock the navbar for the entire site on every page.)

## You Know Your Time Is Passing

We’re not just claiming that time is passing in a general, cosmic sense.  
We’re saying time is passing for you, the individual.

We’ve already established that your experience carries some separateness.  
But how do you know time is passing for that individual self?

Again, we rely on direct experience.

Your sense of self does not remain static.  
Experience is never still; sensations shift, thoughts wander, and conditions constantly change.  
The "you" that exists is continuously undergoing transformation—even while remaining recognizable as the same observer.

You observe entropy directly in your own body: a biological progression in one irreversible direction, easily visible as aging.  
You feel hunger and then fullness; calm and then unease; memory and then forgetting.  
These internal changes form a continuous stream, flowing unmistakably forward.

You remember the past—but never the future.  
Even the narratives you construct to give meaning to your life move forward, never backward.  
You cannot re-enter yesterday, nor retrieve what has passed.  
You cannot undo events that have already occurred. You can break something, but you cannot unbreak it.  
What's done is done.

Thus, your lived experience itself confirms the irreversible directionality we call **time**.  
You know time is passing because you live within an ongoing stream of change that moves relentlessly forward, moment by moment.

## Unlocked Upgrades

So we established time is passing for you. That implies you have a certain time "you" have existed from an origin point. Of course, we capture this by measuring your age.

CHARACTER AGE UPGRADE (GPT-This button should unlock the function of character age on the profile page rather than doing it here. There should be a message after buying the upgrade to see the profile page etc. They should just enter their age manually for now.)

## ...Leading to Your Death

The first two claims are relatively easy to accept.  
This one is harder. But we can limit the claim for clarity.

We’re not trying to prove the totality of death—we’re simply accepting this:

> At some point, the individual perspective you now have will stop.

There may or may not be continuation. But in every observable case, people die and do not return.  
This pattern is universal and uninterrupted.  
So even if there's more to say about what comes next, we can safely claim:

> You, as you currently know yourself, will end.

We see this same reality in animals. In objects.  
A physical object that is destroyed no longer exists as the thing it was.  
It has died, in a sense—it no longer persists in its form.

Death, like time and existence, seems self-evident.

## Unlocked Upgrades

We have accepted we will die. For now let's estimate how many years we have reamining using our age and the world average age of death for person on Earth. Of course, this probably will not reprsent you will at first, but we will iteratively hone our calculations as new evidence and methods emerage as we continue. For now we accept this simple starting point.

LIFESPAN ESTIMATE (GPT-This button should unlock the function of character estimated remaining years before Death. We will start)

## How We Build Characterization

You’ve made several choices now—simple, foundational ones.  
But even these early decisions begin to shape your character.

Let’s first understand how.

To profile someone digitally, it makes sense to describe them as a structure of symbols and relationships.  
Symbols can be words or numbers. Relationships include reinforcement, competition, amplification, suppression.

The simplest symbol is binary: either active or inactive.  
Beyond that, we can use scalars—words tied to numerical values, which can strengthen or weaken over time.  
We can also describe traits along spectrums, showing how a person leans between conceptual poles.

These descriptors shouldn’t exist in isolation.  
They should interact—sometimes reinforcing, sometimes suppressing each other—and behave differently across contexts.

(Other modeling approaches—like latent traits, thresholds, or situational overlays—will emerge naturally later.)

Our first symbolic category is Beliefs.  
Beliefs are stored as “badges,” which consist of a label and a short definition.  
Each badge is also associated with a confidence level that can change over time.

You normally claim badges when making choices in posts. But here, we’re pausing to explain them explicitly.  
You can now claim your first belief badges based on the axioms you’ve accepted.

## What Conclusions Can Be Drawn?

###What We’ve Established So Far

Let’s briefly retrace the path we’ve taken—step by step—starting from the most basic condition of experience.

-Something is being experienced
This is the one fact that cannot be doubted. Even uncertainty itself is an experience.

-Experience implies an experiencing point of view
If something is being experienced, it must appear from somewhere. There is always a frame—even if minimal—through which experience arises.

-A point of view implies a self and a not-self
Having a perspective means there is a distinction between what is within it and what is outside it. This is the first appearance of “me” and “not-me.”

-The self experiences change
The contents of experience shift. Thoughts, sensations, and conditions move and evolve. The self is not fixed—it unfolds through time.

-Change reveals an irreversible flow
Change doesn’t reverse. It has direction. You remember the past, not the future. What happens cannot unhappen.

-That directional flow is what we call time
Your experience confirms this: time moves forward, not backward. The self is carried within a one-way stream.

-Your time will end
Everything you know about living beings and physical objects points to the same conclusion. What has a beginning also has an end. The perspective you now have—however it came to be—will one day cease.

But what follows from that?

Just because you exist doesn’t mean you have agency.  
So before drawing further conclusions, we must ask:

> Can you actually do anything at all?

If we find that we do have agency, then the next question is immediate and inescapable:

> Should we choose to continue existing at all?
