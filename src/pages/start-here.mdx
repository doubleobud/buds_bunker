# WELCOME TO THE BUNKER

## What Is This Place?

You’ve found your way here, which means have discovered a different kind of project.  
This isn’t exactly a blog. It isn’t quite a game. It isn’t just a dev diary.  
It’s pieces of each, combined into something new.

You’re standing at the beginning of a massive unfolding project.  
A digital world that starts with research and planning, and grows update by update into a living interactive simulation.  
Your presence isn’t passive.  
As you continue, you’ll begin defining a character who may one day enter the world I create.

## More Than Just A Developer Log

Every page you read, every log you open, every system you watch grow will contribute to the development of the project.  
But you won’t only be reading and watching. This site will invite your input, and your choices will have consequences.

Your character will start with nothing defining it but a callsign made of six random digits.  
Stick around long enough, and you’ll begin to see a complex portrait of your character emerge all based on your decisions.

Think of this place as a playable devlog.  
Also a workshop, a sketchbook, a prototype lab, and a personal website.  
Everything is housed here in the bunker, and soon you’ll be free to wander and experiment.

## Why It Looks the Way It Does

I’m one person building this. Slowly withe essentially no background in any of these subjects.  
No team just tools to help along with steady, deliberate progress.  
That is the point of it all, and I’ll explain more fully in the project charter.

For now, the website is the game.  
It is about building your character while enjoying the planning and execution of this project.  
There are also going to be functional elements as this endevaor is also about shaping a life that can sustain a long-term creative effort.

If the layout feels sparse, that is intentional.  
I want to begin from the most fundamental point, right here with you.  
Even getting the site live in this early form felt like jumping ahead, but I digress.

## Where Things Go from Here

You’re early, which means you have a front row seat as the foundation is poured.

- **Shape your character take shape** as the core character design is developed  
- **Watch game design concepts emerge** that will define the very core of the world  
- **Read research and design briefs** that seed the first simulation layers  
- **Learn alongside me** as I code, write, compose, and test the first elements

Right now, there’s no grand reveal. No cinematic crawl.  
Just a quiet bunker and a door that opens when you knock.
