# WELCOME TO THE BUNKER

## What Is This Place?

You’ve stepped into something a little different.  
It isn’t quite a blog, and it isn’t quite a game.  
It’s an experiment that sits somewhere in between and it’s only just beginning.

At the start of that experiment is a single question:

> **What is a life well lived?**

Everything that gets built and documented here will grow out of this first question.

---

## More Than Reading

Every page you open and every choice you make shapes a **profile** that belongs to you.  
You’ll start as six random digits nothing more.  
As you read, reflect, and respond, a fuller portrait will emerge.  
Whether that portrait mirrors the real you, an ideal you, or a fictional persona is up to you.

For now, think of this place as a **playable blog**.  
In time, it may evolve into whatever and wherever our investigation takes us.

---

## Why So Minimal?

I’m a team of one: no big budget, no staff, just steady learning in public.  
Starting from zero and letting you watch the scaffolding go up is part of the point.

If the site feels sparse or rough, that’s intentional.  
New sections unlock as you engage, earn currency, and develop your profile.  
Progress happens at your direction and pace.

---

## Jump In

1. **Create an account** so your progress can be saved.  *(Only an email no spam, no selling data; it keeps the bots out.)*
2. You’ll land on your **Profile Page**, where your first act is to claim your six digit callsign.
3. From there, head to the **Origin Timeline** to earn your first token and choose your next step.

No grand reveal. No cinematic crawl.  
Just a quiet bunker and a door that opens when you knock.
