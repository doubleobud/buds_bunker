<p>AI clean up from here</p>
<p>Ok I think I am down to the 'keep everything linkable step' for the best practices part. I think this is just not only links and tagging, but I should add in a TOC, index, tag index/databases etc. This would make the site navigable right from the beginning with every document indexed somewhere.</p>
<p>I have significantly developed the plan now. I’m building out the core navigation and storytelling framework for the site—starting with a mission-control-style homepage, a chronological narrative timeline, and a streamlined “Start Here” guide. The goal is to make everything linkable, discoverable, and future-proof while capturing the story of this project as it unfolds. This is the groundwork that will support everything to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I want to jump right into making sure this website is safe and secure. There’s no reason to start other work until I know this foundation is rock solid. This isn’t just a way to share—this website <em>is</em> the way I work.</p>

<p>Brought over directly from my "Opening Thoughts" document:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Refine and clearly articulate my intentions</strong> for this project using structured best practices informed by these opening thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>Research meta-design concepts</strong> for general projects, goals, and intentions—supporting systematic progress toward objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Develop a detailed plan</strong> for evolving this website in parallel with the universe-building process. Consider thematic or <em>in-character</em> documentation styles, including methods for documenting meta-design development itself.</li>
<li><strong>Implement a digital, online to-do list system.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Initiate blog posting</strong> using a simple, standardized template. Refine the "Opening Thoughts" template further.</li>
<li><strong>Develop a clear roadmap for “Step Zero”</strong>—a foundational phase explicitly encompassing all the above elements.</li>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Develop a detailed plan for evolving this website in parallel with the universe-building process. Consider thematic or <em>in-character</em> documentation styles, including methods for documenting meta-design development itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve done a little research, but I’m going to start by simply jotting down my thoughts:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-foundational-notes">🧱 Foundational Notes<a href="https://doubleobud.github.io/buds_bunker/logs/logs/daily/2025-04-01-second-log#-foundational-notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🧱 Foundational Notes" title="Direct link to 🧱 Foundational Notes">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>a.</strong> I need the website to support my efforts <em>from the top</em>. Systems like the to-do list and document repository should be established early and designed to extend easily.</li>
<li><strong>b.</strong> I want to avoid early mistakes that I'll deeply regret later.</li>
<li><strong>c.</strong> I should borrow ideas from both <strong>Confluence</strong> and <strong>Jira</strong>, which I’ve used before.</li>
<li><strong>d.</strong> I don’t need to develop anything <em>for the universe itself</em> right now—this is about foundational systems.</li>
<li><strong>e.</strong> I should start a section for <strong>notes and instructional materials</strong> inside the docs. It needs to be efficient and integrated with templates. There should be an entire section dedicated to notes on how to make this website function.</li>
<li><strong>f.</strong> What other <em>fundamental</em> website features should I implement now? Anything that would support <em>visitors</em> early on? Not sure.</li>
<li><strong>g.</strong> What needs cleaning up in what I’ve already done? I think my folder structure and naming conventions are a bit messy.</li>
<li><strong>h.</strong> What should I be aware of now that will help me later?</li>
<li><strong>i.</strong> This site will soon begin documenting my research and development process, eventually leading to actual production. Is there anything I should be planning for <em>now</em> that relates to that?</li>
</ul>

<p>See my stream-of-consciousness thoughts above on where I want the website to go next.</p>
<p>You also have some context documents for background, though let’s prioritize my comments in this log.</p>
<p>Try to address each of my points using best practices and relevant examples while meeting my unique needs. Also, please look out for things I might not know—I’m very much a novice with major knowledge gaps. Always be looking out for me like a veteran would.</p>
<p>On that note, try to interpret what I <em>mean</em> even if I’ve said it poorly because of inexperience.</p>

<p>I really need to methodically tune up how I use AI. A lot of my process is homegrown and I’m probably not getting the best results yet.</p>

<p>I’m back. I ran the prompt above and created a full document that outlines how to get the website into a rock-solid foundational state. I chose to focus on this first because every future effort—whether creative or technical—depends on this site working seamlessly.</p>
<p><strong>See the full plan here:</strong><br>
<!-- -->➡️ <a href="https://doubleobud.github.io/buds_bunker/docs/system/website/foundational-guide">Foundational Guide</a></p>
<p>It covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best practices</li>
<li>Folder structures</li>
<li>Git workflows</li>
<li>Early task system setup</li>
<li>Long-term scalability planning</li>
</ul>
<p>This is now the blueprint I’m following going forward.</p>]]></content:encoded>
