# üß® Fifth Log ‚Äì 4/7/25

Another day off yesterday after doing some morning drinking and breakfast with my parents. I really am not sharp enough mentally to do this kind of work after boozing haha.

Today is all about making the site work for users. I just am going to jump into the list below and my general edit of all the pages.
