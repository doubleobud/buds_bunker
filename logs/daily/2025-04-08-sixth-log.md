# ðŸ§¨ Sixth Log â€“ 4/8/25

I am writing this the day after as I got carried away and jumped right back into work yesterday. The homepage is complete for now and looking good. There is some material below the 'hero section' that I need to clean up yet, but I am happy with the top of the screen.

I researched methods of creating user accounts and how I can create save data etc. This resulted and several documents I am pushing forward to implementation in the following days.

Soon I hope to have the bones of the website and the user introduction so we can move on to broader project system designa and implementation.
