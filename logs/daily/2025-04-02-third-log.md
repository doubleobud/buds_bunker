# 🧨 Third Log — April 2nd, 2025

Today I will continue to implement all the best practices from the Website Foundational Guide. I completed the first pass on the file structure system ahead of schedule, so we are going to keep advancing the cause.

## 🧩 Linking + Navigation System Buildout

At this stage, I’m focusing on the “Keep Everything Linkable” step—not just ensuring files aren’t orphaned, but creating a deliberate, layered navigation framework.

This means implementing:
- A full **Table of Contents (TOC)** structure
- A browsable **tag index and category index**
- **Cross-linking** all major documents to one another where contextually relevant
- Ensuring **every document is reachable from multiple paths** (sidebar, tag, homepage link, etc.)

I'm treating navigation itself as a system. The goal is for any page—no matter how small or experimental—to live somewhere findable and contextualized, now and in the future.

## 🧠 Navigation + Storytelling Strategy Now Locked

Today I finalized the plan for the site's core storytelling and navigational experience. It's composed of three main pillars:

### 🏠 Homepage as Mission Control  
The homepage will serve as the primary navigational hub—not a dashboard with live updates, but a structured, intentional map of the site. It will orient new users, direct followers to the leading edge of the narrative, and organize all categories and tools for me as creator.

### 🧵 Chronological Narrative Timeline  
This is the backbone of the story. A long-form narrative log of the entire project’s evolution—milestones, pivots, progress, and reflections—each with links to the logs, research, or documents they connect to.

### 🧭 Start Here Page  
An onboarding document that teaches newcomers how to understand and use the site. It includes explanations of folders, tags, log types, naming conventions, and where to jump in based on interest.

I’m locking in this plan going forward. These three elements will be the permanent triad that guides site structure from here out. The [Website Navigation Plan](/docs/system/website/navigation-system-plan) document has all the specifics.

## 🧪 Personal Reflection

There’s a strange satisfaction in doing all this. It feels like world-building—not in a fictional sense, but in an infrastructural one. I’m setting up the scaffolding for a world I haven’t fully built yet, and that’s exciting. It makes it easier to imagine what this place could grow into.

Once this groundwork is stable, it will allow everything else—fiction, logs, systems, experiments—to evolve organically without collapsing under their own weight.

## 🔮 What’s Next

- Finalize homepage layout (design + content)
- Draft the narrative timeline structure and initial entries
- Build out the Start Here page
- Complete the tag index system
- Write the “Document Your Own Rules” page with conventions and style guides

The site is just about ready to support its own evolution. From here on out, it’s all about populating the structure and letting the story breathe.
