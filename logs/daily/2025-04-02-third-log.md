# 🧨 Third Log — April 2st, 2025

Today I will continue to implement all the best practices for the Website Foundational Guide. I completed the first pass on the file structure system ahead of schedule, so we are going to keep advancing the cause.

## ⛳ Next Steps from “Foundational Guide”

Brought over directly from my [Foundational Guide](/docs/system/website/foundational-guide) document:

### ✅ File & Folder Structure: COMPLETE

### ✅ Naming Conventions: COMPLETE

### ✅ Git Hygiene: COMPLETE

### ✅ Preview Before Deploy: COMPLETE

### ✅ Track Your Site’s History: COMPLETE

### ✅ Versioning Discipline: COMPLETE

### ✅ Don’t Over-Customize Yet: COMPLETE

### ✅ Keep Everything Linkable: Needs improved along with tag system

### ✅ Use Frontmatter Early: COMPLETE

### ✅ Document Your Own Rules: Need to put all this stuff together in one package for my use and AI use. Do at the end of the rest of this.

AI clean up from here

Ok I think I am down to the 'keep everything linkable step' for the best practices part. I think this is just not only links and tagging, but I should add in a TOC, index, tag index/databases etc. This would make the site navigable right from the beginning with every document indexed somewhere.

I have significantly developed the plan now. I’m building out the core navigation and storytelling framework for the site—starting with a mission-control-style homepage, a chronological narrative timeline, and a streamlined “Start Here” guide. The goal is to make everything linkable, discoverable, and future-proof while capturing the story of this project as it unfolds. This is the groundwork that will support everything to come.
