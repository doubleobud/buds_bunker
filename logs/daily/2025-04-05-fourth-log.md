# üß® Fourth Log ‚Äì 4/5/25

I took a few days off as my wife left town to head to Las Vegas. I essentially watched Game of Thrones the entire two days as I had never seen it before and the early seasons were quite good.

Now I want to push into creating all the navigation elements for the site to allow me and any visitors to understand what is happening.

I am still very much wrestling with the idea of whether this part of the website is purely functional or should serve as a narrative or even game-lite experience. I think I have at least settled on providing the story of what I am doing as more of a narrative someone can follow through‚Äîthink devlog with all resources integrated along with thoughts, etc.

I feel all this effort would be much more worthwhile if it was somehow a standalone product in and of itself. Perhaps that is where the narrative page can come in.

As a to-do, I should consider a simplified presentation starting point to fit the theme if I go this route. It's funny because the development could mirror my technical ramp-up.

This is such a pain in the ass right now. I do not know why this does not update. This should be showing up and it is not again. I keep having to update this to get it to show up.
