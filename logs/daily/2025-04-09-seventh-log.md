# ðŸ§¨ Seventh Log â€“ 4/9/25

I have already taken last night's research and rolled that into documentation to build today's process. My file management is slipping right now, but I am close to starting the narrative which should organize the entire process for both me and the user.

I know my writing is not as interesting at this point, but I plan to revamp this process once I am past this website setup phase. I feel progressing any further without that in place would be a major mistake.
