# ðŸ§¨ First Log â€“ 3/31/25

I have finally structured this website properly after one failed attempt and now I have come to my first log.

I fully intend to add more structure to these posts over time, but I wanted to start from the simplest point possible for now.

Today I worked extensively on my [Project Charter](/docs/project/project-charter) document to capture my starting point and my initial intentions.
