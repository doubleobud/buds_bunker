# 🧨 Second Log — April 1st, 2025

I want to jump right into making sure this website is safe and secure. There’s no reason to start other work until I know this foundation is rock solid. This isn’t just a way to share—this website *is* the way I work.

## ⛳ Next Steps from “Opening Thoughts”

Brought over directly from my "Opening Thoughts" document:

1. **Refine and clearly articulate my intentions** for this project using structured best practices informed by these opening thoughts.  
2. **Research meta-design concepts** for general projects, goals, and intentions—supporting systematic progress toward objectives.  
3. **Develop a detailed plan** for evolving this website in parallel with the universe-building process. Consider thematic or *in-character* documentation styles, including methods for documenting meta-design development itself.  
4. **Implement a digital, online to-do list system.**  
5. **Initiate blog posting** using a simple, standardized template. Refine the "Opening Thoughts" template further.  
6. **Develop a clear roadmap for “Step Zero”**—a foundational phase explicitly encompassing all the above elements.

## 🛠 Tackling Step 3 First: Evolve the Website

> **3.** Develop a detailed plan for evolving this website in parallel with the universe-building process. Consider thematic or *in-character* documentation styles, including methods for documenting meta-design development itself.

I’ve done a little research, but I’m going to start by simply jotting down my thoughts:

### 🧱 Foundational Notes

- **a.** I need the website to support my efforts *from the top*. Systems like the to-do list and document repository should be established early and designed to extend easily.
- **b.** I want to avoid early mistakes that I'll deeply regret later.
- **c.** I should borrow ideas from both **Confluence** and **Jira**, which I’ve used before.
- **d.** I don’t need to develop anything *for the universe itself* right now—this is about foundational systems.
- **e.** I should start a section for **notes and instructional materials** inside the docs. It needs to be efficient and integrated with templates. There should be an entire section dedicated to notes on how to make this website function.
- **f.** What other *fundamental* website features should I implement now? Anything that would support *visitors* early on? Not sure.
- **g.** What needs cleaning up in what I’ve already done? I think my folder structure and naming conventions are a bit messy.
- **h.** What should I be aware of now that will help me later?
- **i.** This site will soon begin documenting my research and development process, eventually leading to actual production. Is there anything I should be planning for *now* that relates to that?

## 🤖 Prompt for AI Support

> See my stream-of-consciousness thoughts above on where I want the website to go next.  
> 
> You also have some context documents for background, though let’s prioritize my comments in this log.  
> 
> Try to address each of my points using best practices and relevant examples while meeting my unique needs. Also, please look out for things I might not know—I’m very much a novice with major knowledge gaps. Always be looking out for me like a veteran would.  
> 
> On that note, try to interpret what I *mean* even if I’ve said it poorly because of inexperience.

## 🧠 Meta-Level Note

I really need to methodically tune up how I use AI. A lot of my process is homegrown and I’m probably not getting the best results yet.

## 🏋️ Break Time

Heading off to work out. This afternoon, I’ll start working on the plan.

## 🔧 Follow-Up: Implementation Plan Chosen

I’m back. I ran the prompt above and created a full document that outlines how to get the website into a rock-solid foundational state. I chose to focus on this first because every future effort—whether creative or technical—depends on this site working seamlessly.

**See the full plan here:**  
➡️ [Foundational Guide](/docs/system/website/foundational-guide)

It covers:
- Best practices  
- Folder structures  
- Git workflows  
- Early task system setup  
- Long-term scalability planning

This is now the blueprint I’m following going forward.
