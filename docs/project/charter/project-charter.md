# üåÄ Project Charter

**Welcome!** This charter captures the structured yet raw early-stage thinking behind Bud‚Äôs Universe. It‚Äôs designed to organize your ideas without disrupting creative flow‚Äîperfect for new phases, fresh cycles, or major pivots.

## üó∫Ô∏è 1. Current Situation

- **Date & Time:** March 31, 2025, at 6:03 PM  
- **Author:** doubleobud  
- **Location:** Home in Peoria, IL

In an ideal scenario, I would have initiated this entry neatly from the very beginning. I've made several attempts at starting projects similar to the one I'll describe below. However, these earlier efforts haven't been wasted, as they've provided valuable lessons and essential components that I carry forward into this current attempt.

Even with this new effort, I began in earnest around ten days ago. Initially, I anticipated quickly setting up this website and immediately beginning to post logs. That didn't happen because I accidentally reverted to an old version of the site due to a version control mistake, losing my progress.

This broader, more holistic effort began due to a similar mistake. I wasn't properly utilizing version control for my digital novel project and accidentally destroyed my working copy, with no backup available. I didn't realize that simply saving my work wasn't sufficient when working within Unity!

So, here we are‚Äîthe website is now up and running, and I'm beginning anew on the project I'll outline below.

## üåê 2. High-Level Concept

My goal is to create an interactive, simulated universe, along with a lifestyle designed to support and indirectly enrich this overarching project.

## üå™Ô∏è 3. Stream of Consciousness

I envision this as a lifelong endeavor, serving multiple purposes: a creative outlet, a structured venue for learning, something shareable (perhaps even outliving me), and most importantly‚Äîenjoyable. The project is stated above as an interactive simulated universe, and it very much is. Many systems and designs may never directly result in playable gameplay but will enrich the world's depth nonetheless. Everything I integrate should be meticulously researched, designed, and carefully integrated into the final cohesive experience.

I want to linger on the idea that this is a project and look at everything to do with the meta-design of projects, goals, intentions, initiatives, etc. while drawing upon best practices from science and business. On that note, I need to use extensive best practices to program this experience so I can use modularity and interfaces to keep bolting in small bits over time without disrupting what has already been built. I cannot stress enough the blending of best practices‚Äîmethodical, thoughtful approaches‚Äîwhere I at least consider all the best ways even if I select my own path made of pieces of things, etc.

Narrative and fiction play central roles in this project. I need to be writing a lot and figure out ways to incorporate all this into an emergent system. Really, the whole experience needs to be emergent and built from the pieces I create. That really extends to all the art required for this experience, as I need to be creating things consistently that will lead to more and more outcomes possible from combinations.

I want to be able to play this game at some point as well. The simulation should surprise me as it gets more and more complex over time. Part of this too will be using the emerging AI tools that are only getting better and better. Soon I will be creating pieces of this universe en masse, so I want to start now as slowly and methodically as possible, starting with a true step zero that focuses on the meta-design of just projects in general and lifestyle building, etc.

Documenting everything thoroughly is a core priority. This commitment is why I launched the website before writing this piece‚Äîsharing my work increases its meaningfulness. Starting simply allows for a scalable progression toward complexity. Eventually, this website itself might become an immersive component of the overall experience (though that's still an exploratory idea).

Beyond mere research, I see this project as an ongoing journey of lifelong learning. The universe I'm building is a canvas offering endless possibilities for exploring my interests. I'll engage with a variety of media to deepen my understanding and skill set. While early stages may impose certain constraints, even my recreational activities and entertainment will ideally contribute indirectly to the overall project.

Indeed, I aim to align much of my personal life with this endeavor, directly or indirectly. For example, maintaining good health may not appear directly related to world-building, yet it's fundamental for sustained creative output. I don't view this alignment as restrictive, given the vast and diverse subject matter available for exploration.

I really want to carefully understand and emulate the histories involved with all the main topics‚Äîcomputers, video games, and to a lesser extent, art, music, writing, etc. I want to develop my universe and skills along those lines to some degree. I can create in-narrative reasons for the technological scale-up, etc. This allows me to get started, understand history, and have a theme I can build around.

This is one of the most important things to me. I want to really take the best things that have already been made and make the best combination of the system using bits and pieces of the best things. Like, if I am making an inventory system, that system would first be broken down, but then you could find the best bits of all time of that and combine them, etc.

I do not care about money at all, but if I did make some, I would only use it to develop the game more. I want to develop some very small things at first and perhaps even release them to Steam. However, everything I ever make should fit in the universe somewhere. This could go so far as there being a video game system in the universe where they play my most primitive games, etc.

Ultimately, the lifestyle I cultivate to support this project should bring me closer to becoming the person I aspire to be, enriching my life far beyond the boundaries of the project itself.

## üí¨ 4. Next Steps

- **1:** Refine and clearly articulate my intentions for this project using structured best practices informed by these opening thoughts.  
- **2:** Research meta-design concepts for general projects, goals, and intentions‚Äîenabling systematic progress toward objectives.  
- **3:** Develop a detailed plan for evolving this website in parallel with the universe-building process. Consider thematic or "in-character" documentation styles, including methods for documenting meta-design development itself.  
- **4:** Implement a digital, online to-do list system.  
- **5:** Initiate blog posting using a simple, standardized template; refine the charter template further.  
- **6:** Develop a clear roadmap for ‚ÄúStep Zero‚Äù‚Äîa foundational phase explicitly encompassing all of the above.
