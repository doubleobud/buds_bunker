<p><strong>Welcome!</strong> This charter captures the structured yet raw early-stage thinking behind Bud’s Universe. It’s designed to organize your ideas without disrupting creative flow—perfect for new phases, fresh cycles, or major pivots.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to Bud&#x27;s Bunker!</strong> I am Bud, and I am calling this site my bunker as I want to evoke the sense of this being a place a separated from the outside world. I want to collect all my digital projects here as well which seems very fitting for the concept of a bunker where everything you need is one place. Lastly, I spend an inordinate amount of time as of late working on this and I am essentially &#x27;bunkered&#x27; up inside while doing so espically being so fortunate having not do work.</p>
<p>So what exactly is the goal here? I want to create something, a large complicated project that uses all my faculties and abilties. I want to create the project without limitations and I want to easily share whatever I create. That points directly to the digital space, computers, and programming. This would have not been very pratical even a few years ago, but now the tools have improved to the point it is practical for me to learn and produce digitial projects with no prior experience.</p>
<p>From this point, it seems I have choice between producing something more functional or something more creative. I have no pressure to produce income from my efforts as this is purely a hobby, so perhaps an app is not the way to go. I am thinking perhaps I could intergrate a purely functional project with a purely creative one. I will come back to this idea as we progress and I can show you what I mean as this seems like a riddle without an example.</p>
<p>So, what are the types of creative programming projects I can pursue? Obivously a website is underway, but there are many more possibilties. I want to bring in as many other elements as possible from the creative side too that are not digital at their core. To me this means writing, art, and music all should be apart of the creative effot. This seems to point to some kind of video game as that is the only thing that intergrates all these things.</p>
<p>However, I don&#x27;t want to just create art as I want to experience my creation. I think that leaves me with some key terms we can formulate to set the very smallest kernal of information to narraow our project effots. Those words are INTERACTIVE, SIMULATION, AND UNIVERSE. This website exists to support the production of this universe and to let others follow and participate in the project as it develops. I plan on documenting each step of my process, including the creation of a lifestyle that will support this effort as I hinted at above.</p>

<p>To be candid, the full scope of this project is still evolving. However, breaking down my chosen words can clarify the direction:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Simulation</strong> – At its core, I aim to create a computer program that spawns individual agents acting in a shared worldspace, governed by rules and statistics that produce emergent behavior. The ultimate goal is to emulate real-world dynamics as broadly as possible. With unlimited resources, this could include political, economic, social, and cultural systems—but for now, I’ll focus on fundamental elements and scale upward gradually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Universe</strong> – I use this term for two reasons. First, I want all my efforts to converge into a single, cohesive project. Second, I’m intrigued by incorporating narrative generation, tying the mathematics of the simulation to a broader sense of story that shapes individual behavior beyond simple needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interactive</strong> – I don’t just want to build this project in isolation; I want to interact with it myself and allow others to join in. You might call it a video game, but I’m starting with features reminiscent of novels and early tabletop RPGs, where mechanics and text drive the experience rather than sophisticated graphics. Over time, as my skills improve, the visual side will grow too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> – Ultimately, the goal is to unify all these pieces into a single vision: a living, ever-evolving simulation-RPG that grows richer and more visually robust as time goes on.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some practical advice says documentation like this can be a distraction, but I believe it serves several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong> – I built this website to act as a personal repository for all my project materials, ensuring they stay under my control. By integrating my workflows here, I can streamline development and keep everything accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enjoyment</strong> – The process is where the joy really lies for me. I love researching, experimenting with methods, and then applying them in a structured way. While I do care about the final outcome, sharing my process with others makes the journey more meaningful—maybe even helpful or inspiring for someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immediate Interactivity</strong> – This is the most exciting feature so far. By following along with the project, you can start building a “character” right now. Eventually, that character may be granted entry to the developing simulation. I’ll explain more in the next section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-exactly-is-this-site-interactive-right-away">How Exactly Is This Site Interactive Right Away?<a href="#how-exactly-is-this-site-interactive-right-away" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Exactly Is This Site Interactive Right Away?" title="Direct link to How Exactly Is This Site Interactive Right Away?">​</a></h2>
<p>Creating a character will be central to any simulation interaction. Your character should reflect your real interests and strengths in some ways, and this website will help shape that. I plan to implement three core features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading Codex</strong><br>
<!-- -->Each unique page on the site is cataloged in a compendium that tracks your progress. As you discover more pages, your character will gain stats and attributes tied to the knowledge you’ve unlocked. I’ll detail these systems in coming weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword Collection</strong><br>
<!-- -->Each page contains information that unlocks certain keywords, which your character “stores.” As the simulation’s systems evolve, these keywords will enable specific actions for your avatar—even outside the main simulation space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tests and Puzzles</strong><br>
<!-- -->When you finish reading certain pages, you can choose responses that shape your character’s statistics or traits. All these efforts also work toward a larger test—though I can’t say anything further about that just yet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-can-you-get-started">How Can You Get Started?<a href="#how-can-you-get-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How Can You Get Started?" title="Direct link to How Can You Get Started?">​</a></h2>
<p>To track your progress, you’ll need to create an account (see the button below). After that, you’ll begin the first narrative section, which I’ll explain shortly. Be aware that some areas of the site require you to prove you’re ready before granting access.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Account Creation</strong><br>
<!-- -->Click the button below to begin creating your avatar. This won’t be an elaborate process where you pick every detail upfront. Your avatar will evolve over time. I sometimes use “avatar” and “character” interchangeably, though there is a subtle distinction—more on that in the future. For now, you’ll just receive a unique identifier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Narratives</strong><br>
<!-- -->As you begin your journey through the site, you’ll be guided until you reach a certain level of competency. Once you have an avatar, you can begin the first narrative, which delves into the project charter and the technical setup behind this website. Both topics will offer opportunities to shape your avatar’s traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locked Content</strong><br>
<!-- -->I plan to share as much as possible with you throughout this course of discovery. However, there is a larger purpose behind this world’s creation. If I revealed it now, you likely wouldn’t believe me—and, in truth, I can only reveal it to those who demonstrate they’re prepared. Not everyone will unlock the entire site, but those who do will eventually join the simulation in full (though that’s a long way off yet).</p>
</li>

<p>In an ideal scenario, I would have initiated this entry neatly from the very beginning. I&#x27;ve made several attempts at starting projects similar to the one I&#x27;ll describe below. However, these earlier efforts haven&#x27;t been wasted, as they&#x27;ve provided valuable lessons and essential components that I carry forward into this current attempt.</p>
<p>Even with this new effort, I began in earnest around ten days ago. Initially, I anticipated quickly setting up this website and immediately beginning to post logs. That didn&#x27;t happen because I accidentally reverted to an old version of the site due to a version control mistake, losing my progress.</p>
<p>This broader, more holistic effort began due to a similar mistake. I wasn&#x27;t properly utilizing version control for my digital novel project and accidentally destroyed my working copy, with no backup available. I didn&#x27;t realize that simply saving my work wasn&#x27;t sufficient when working within Unity!</p>
<p>So, here we are—the website is now up and running, and I&#x27;m beginning anew on the project I&#x27;ll outline below.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-2-high-level-concept">🌐 2. High-Level Concept<a href="#-2-high-level-concept" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🌐 2. High-Level Concept" title="Direct link to 🌐 2. High-Level Concept">​</a></h2>
<p>My goal is to create an interactive, simulated universe, along with a lifestyle designed to support and indirectly enrich this overarching project.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-3-stream-of-consciousness">🌪️ 3. Stream of Consciousness<a href="#️-3-stream-of-consciousness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🌪️ 3. Stream of Consciousness" title="Direct link to 🌪️ 3. Stream of Consciousness">​</a></h2>
<p>I envision this as a lifelong endeavor, serving multiple purposes: a creative outlet, a structured venue for learning, something shareable (perhaps even outliving me), and most importantly—enjoyable. The project is stated above as an interactive simulated universe, and it very much is. Many systems and designs may never directly result in playable gameplay but will enrich the world&#x27;s depth nonetheless. Everything I integrate should be meticulously researched, designed, and carefully integrated into the final cohesive experience.</p>
<p>I want to linger on the idea that this is a project and look at everything to do with the meta-design of projects, goals, intentions, initiatives, etc. while drawing upon best practices from science and business. On that note, I need to use extensive best practices to program this experience so I can use modularity and interfaces to keep bolting in small bits over time without disrupting what has already been built. I cannot stress enough the blending of best practices—methodical, thoughtful approaches—where I at least consider all the best ways even if I select my own path made of pieces of things, etc.</p>
<p>Narrative and fiction play central roles in this project. I need to be writing a lot and figure out ways to incorporate all this into an emergent system. Really, the whole experience needs to be emergent and built from the pieces I create. That really extends to all the art required for this experience, as I need to be creating things consistently that will lead to more and more outcomes possible from combinations.</p>
<p>I want to be able to play this game at some point as well. The simulation should surprise me as it gets more and more complex over time. Part of this too will be using the emerging AI tools that are only getting better and better. Soon I will be creating pieces of this universe en masse, so I want to start now as slowly and methodically as possible, starting with a true step zero that focuses on the meta-design of just projects in general and lifestyle building, etc.</p>
<p>Documenting everything thoroughly is a core priority. This commitment is why I launched the website before writing this piece—sharing my work increases its meaningfulness. Starting simply allows for a scalable progression toward complexity. Eventually, this website itself might become an immersive component of the overall experience (though that&#x27;s still an exploratory idea).</p>
<p>Beyond mere research, I see this project as an ongoing journey of lifelong learning. The universe I&#x27;m building is a canvas offering endless possibilities for exploring my interests. I&#x27;ll engage with a variety of media to deepen my understanding and skill set. While early stages may impose certain constraints, even my recreational activities and entertainment will ideally contribute indirectly to the overall project.</p>
<p>Indeed, I aim to align much of my personal life with this endeavor, directly or indirectly. For example, maintaining good health may not appear directly related to world-building, yet it&#x27;s fundamental for sustained creative output. I don&#x27;t view this alignment as restrictive, given the vast and diverse subject matter available for exploration.</p>
<p>I really want to carefully understand and emulate the histories involved with all the main topics—computers, video games, and to a lesser extent, art, music, writing, etc. I want to develop my universe and skills along those lines to some degree. I can create in-narrative reasons for the technological scale-up, etc. This allows me to get started, understand history, and have a theme I can build around.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important things to me. I want to really take the best things that have already been made and make the best combination of the system using bits and pieces of the best things. Like, if I am making an inventory system, that system would first be broken down, but then you could find the best bits of all time of that and combine them, etc.</p>
<p>I do not care about money at all, but if I did make some, I would only use it to develop the game more. I want to develop some very small things at first and perhaps even release them to Steam. However, everything I ever make should fit in the universe somewhere. This could go so far as there being a video game system in the universe where they play my most primitive games, etc.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the lifestyle I cultivate to support this project should bring me closer to becoming the person I aspire to be, enriching my life far beyond the boundaries of the project itself.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1:</strong> Refine and clearly articulate my intentions for this project using structured best practices informed by these opening thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>2:</strong> Research meta-design concepts for general projects, goals, and intentions—enabling systematic progress toward objectives.</li>
<li><strong>3:</strong> Develop a detailed plan for evolving this website in parallel with the universe-building process. Consider thematic or &quot;in-character&quot; documentation styles, including methods for documenting meta-design development itself.</li>
<li><strong>4:</strong> Implement a digital, online to-do list system.</li>
<li><strong>5:</strong> Initiate blog posting using a simple, standardized template; refine the charter template further.</li>
<li><strong>6:</strong> Develop a clear roadmap for “Step Zero”—a foundational phase explicitly encompassing all of the above.</li>
