# üåÄ Opening Thoughts

**Welcome!** This framework was made for capturing raw, early-stage thinking with structure. It gives just enough scaffolding to contain the chaos of a raw idea without killing creative flow at the start of projects, phases, or mental pivots.

## üó∫Ô∏è 1. Current Situation

In a perfect world, I would have started this entry cleanly right from the beginning. I have had several starts and stops at beginning the type of project I will describe below. Much of those efforts have not been wasted in the least though, as lessons were learned and important pieces were carried forward.

Even with this current effort, I started in earnest ten days ago. I thought getting this website up would go quicker with logs starting right behind that. That did not happen because I wiped the website with a version control bust where I restored an old copy over a branch.

This more holistic effort I am starting now kicked off for the same reason. I was not running version control on my digital novel, and I destroyed my working copy without being able to reload it. I had no idea that saving was not enough in Unity!

So here we are‚Äîthe website is up and running, and we are starting a new project that I will describe next.

## üåê 2. High Level Concept

Create my own interactive simulated universe, including the lifestyle that supports and indirectly contributes to the overall project.

## üå™Ô∏è 3. Stream of Consciousness Thoughts

I want to create a project that will last a lifetime, serve as a creative outlet and hobby, a venue for learning in a structured way, something I can share with others‚Äîpossibly even outlasting me‚Äîand just be plain fun to do. I want to linger on the idea that this is a project and look at everything to do with the meta-design of projects, goals, intentions, initiatives, etc. while drawing upon best practices from science and business.

The project is stated above as an interactive simulated universe, and it very much is. There will be much designed on systems that never lead to gameplay but still build the world and add to its depth. Each thing I add can be carefully researched, designed, and implemented to keep bolted together in the integrated final product. 

On that note, I need to use extensive best practices to program this experience so I can use modularity and interfaces to keep bolting in small bits over time without disrupting what has already been built.

I have mentioned research already, but it's more than that. I want to be a lifelong learner, and the universe offers up plenty of opportunity to explore whatever topic I am interested in over time. I would like to use a variety of media to accomplish this. I acknowledge the early parts of making this will constrain the subject matter some. Also, even entertainment and things I do should contribute to the design or research of the universe in some way.

That leads me to the point that I want my whole life to be tied to this endeavor in some way. It doesn‚Äôt always have to be direct either. Like, I need to be healthy to make the best things, and perhaps many of those tasks won‚Äôt contribute much other than that. I really don't think it's that restrictive when you think about the scope and variety of subject matter available to me.

Narrative and fiction are also a huge part of this. I need to be writing a lot and figure out ways to incorporate all this into an emergent system. Really, the whole experience needs to be emergent and built from the pieces I create. That really extends to all the art required for this experience, as I need to be creating things consistently that will lead to more and more outcomes possible from combinations.

I want to be able to play this game at some point as well. The simulation should surprise me as it gets more and more complex over time. Part of this too will be using the emerging AI tools that are only getting better and better. Soon I will be creating pieces of this universe en masse, so I want to start now as slowly and methodically as possible, starting with a true step zero that focuses on the meta-design of just projects in general and lifestyle building, etc.

As you can tell, a priority right from the beginning is to document everything‚Äîhence why I started this website before I even wrote this piece. We want to document everything, as the sharing of this work makes this feel even more worthwhile to do. I want to start simple, as I have, but I intend to scale up this experience. I might even make this website an immersive part of the experience as you go through the site (only a maybe).

I cannot stress enough the blending of best practices‚Äîmethodical, thoughtful approaches‚Äîwhere I at least consider all the best ways even if I select my own path made of pieces of things, etc.

I do not care about money at all, but if I did make some, I would only use it to develop the game more. I want to develop some very small things at first and perhaps even release them to Steam. However, everything I ever make should fit in the universe somewhere. This could go so far as there being a video game system in the universe where they play my most primitive games, etc.

I really want to carefully understand and emulate the histories involved with all the main topics‚Äîcomputers, video games, and to a lesser extent, art, music, writing, etc. I want to develop my universe and skills along those lines to some degree. I can create in-narrative reasons for the technological scale-up, etc. This allows me to get started, understand history, and have a theme I can build around.

This is one of the most important things to me. I want to really take the best things that have already been made and make the best combination of the system using bits and pieces of the best things. Like, if I am making an inventory system, that system would first be broken down, but then you could find the best bits of all time of that and combine them, etc.

The lifestyle I build to support this should lead me to the best life possible and make me closer to the person I wish I was.

## üí¨ 4. Next Steps

- **1:** Refine and clarify my intent for this project using best practices and my opening thoughts here.
- **2:** Research meta-design type concepts for general projects, goals, and/or intentions that will allow for the building of systems to accomplish objectives.
- **3:** Create a plan to develop this website alongside efforts to develop the process to build the universe. Consider whether this will be presented in character or not. This includes how I document the creation of the process itself related to this meta-design phase.
- **4:** Create a digital, online to-do list system.
- **5:** Create a roadmap for a "Step Zero" of a project initiation that encompasses all previous elements here.
