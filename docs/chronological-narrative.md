# 📖 The Buds Bunker Narrative

This is the running timeline of Buds Bunker—its construction, its experiments, and its evolution.

Every update here reflects a moment in the broader project’s development. Logs, breakthroughs, pivots, reorganizations, and insights will all be tracked here.

## 📅 Phase 0: Setup, Foundation, and Meta-Design

### 🗓️ March 31, 2025 — [First Log](/logs/daily/2025-03-31-first-log)

> After years of circling this idea, I’m finally starting Buds Bunker for real. I’m taking the long road: methodical, designed, and sustainable. This site is the first step.

---

### 🗓️ April 1, 2025 — [Second Log: Website Planning](/logs/daily/2025-04-01-second-log)

> This entry kicks off the real strategic work: defining how this site supports the project. I brainstorm how it will evolve, how to avoid early mistakes, and why the website *is* the work.

---

### 🗓️ April 2, 2025 — [Third Log](/logs/daily/2025-04-02-third-log)

> Continued refining the structural foundation. I'm leaning into a “narrative-first” design strategy and clarified how logs, templates, and documentation should evolve.

---

### 🗓️ April 5, 2025 — [Fourth Log](/logs/daily/2025-04-05-fourth-log)

> Homepage and onboarding pages are now built. I’m moving quickly through foundational elements, setting the stage for deeper creative and meta-design work.

## 🧩 What's Next

- Begin defining “Phase 1” soon—this will focus on actual creative output, not just infrastructure.
- Potential entries to include:
  - First world-building doc
  - Initial research structure
  - Simulation sketch
  - Early Unity prototypes

---

## 🧠 Notes

- This page will grow over time.
- Consider structuring into **chapters** or **arcs** later (e.g., “Phase 0: Infrastructure”, “Phase 1: Narrative”, “Phase 2: Systems”).
