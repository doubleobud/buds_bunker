# 🌀 Opening Thoughts

**Welcome!** This framework is made for capturing raw, early-stage thinking with just enough structure. Use it to contain the chaos of a fresh idea without stifling creativity. Use this as a snapshot of your mind at the start of a new project, phase, or pivot.

## 🗺️ 1. Current Situation

- **Date & Time:** <!-- When are you writing this? -->
- **Author:** <!-- Who are you? -->
- **Location:** <!-- Where are you writing from? -->

Prompt:  
What led you to start this entry right now? Are there any recent events, frustrations, sparks of insight, or shifts in mindset that brought you here? Capture the raw truth, even if messy or unclear.

## 🌐 2. High Level Concept

Prompt:  
What's the core idea, dream, or vision you're starting with? Try to summarize your project or intention in one sentence, even if it's vague or idealistic. What excites you most about it?

## 🌪️ 3. Stream of Consciousness Thoughts

Prompt:  
Let your thoughts run wild here. What do you hope this becomes? Why does it matter to you? What emotions, doubts, ambitions, or questions do you have? Write freely. Anything goes—no edits, no judgment.

Guiding questions if you're stuck:
- What long-term vision do you see for this?
- How do you want your lifestyle to align with this?
- What principles or best practices will guide you?
- What types of media, disciplines, or tools do you imagine using?
- What excites or scares you about starting?
- How could this idea evolve into something immersive, shareable, or lasting?
