## Introduction

**Welcome to Bud's Bunker!** I am Bud, and I have a vision of building an interactive simulation universe. This website exists to support the production of that project and to let others follow (and eventually participate in) the story as it develops. I plan on documenting each step of my process, including the creation of a lifestyle that will enrich this overarching effort.

## What Is an Interactive Simulation Universe?

To be candid, the full scope of this project is still evolving. However, breaking down my chosen words can clarify the direction:

- **Simulation** – At its core, I aim to create a computer program that spawns individual agents acting in a shared worldspace, governed by rules and statistics that produce emergent behavior. The ultimate goal is to emulate real-world dynamics as broadly as possible. With unlimited resources, this could include political, economic, social, and cultural systems—but for now, I’ll focus on fundamental elements and scale upward gradually.

- **Universe** – I use this term for two reasons. First, I want all my efforts to converge into a single, cohesive project. Second, I’m intrigued by incorporating narrative generation, tying the mathematics of the simulation to a broader sense of story that shapes individual behavior beyond simple needs.

- **Interactive** – I don’t just want to build this project in isolation; I want to interact with it myself and allow others to join in. You might call it a video game, but I’m starting with features reminiscent of novels and early tabletop RPGs, where mechanics and text drive the experience rather than sophisticated graphics. Over time, as my skills improve, the visual side will grow too.

- **Conclusion** – Ultimately, the goal is to unify all these pieces into a single vision: a living, ever-evolving simulation-RPG that grows richer and more visually robust as time goes on.

## Why Document the Development of the Project?

Some practical advice says documentation like this can be a distraction, but I believe it serves several purposes:

- **Efficiency** – I built this website to act as a personal repository for all my project materials, ensuring they stay under my control. By integrating my workflows here, I can streamline development and keep everything accessible.

- **Enjoyment** – The process is where the joy really lies for me. I love researching, experimenting with methods, and then applying them in a structured way. While I do care about the final outcome, sharing my process with others makes the journey more meaningful—maybe even helpful or inspiring for someone else.

- **Immediate Interactivity** – This is the most exciting feature so far. By following along with the project, you can start building a “character” right now. Eventually, that character may be granted entry to the developing simulation. I’ll explain more in the next section.

## How Exactly Is This Site Interactive Right Away?

Creating a character will be central to any simulation interaction. Your character should reflect your real interests and strengths in some ways, and this website will help shape that. I plan to implement three core features:

- **Reading Codex**  
  Each unique page on the site is cataloged in a compendium that tracks your progress. As you discover more pages, your character will gain stats and attributes tied to the knowledge you’ve unlocked. I’ll detail these systems in coming weeks.

- **Keyword Collection**  
  Each page contains information that unlocks certain keywords, which your character “stores.” As the simulation’s systems evolve, these keywords will enable specific actions for your avatar—even outside the main simulation space.

- **Tests and Puzzles**  
  When you finish reading certain pages, you can choose responses that shape your character’s statistics or traits. All these efforts also work toward a larger test—though I can’t say anything further about that just yet.

## How Can You Get Started?

To track your progress, you’ll need to create an account (see the button below). After that, you’ll begin the first narrative section, which I’ll explain shortly. Be aware that some areas of the site require you to prove you’re ready before granting access.

- **Account Creation**  
  Click the button below to begin creating your avatar. This won’t be an elaborate process where you pick every detail upfront. Your avatar will evolve over time. I sometimes use “avatar” and “character” interchangeably, though there is a subtle distinction—more on that in the future. For now, you’ll just receive a unique identifier.

- **Narratives**  
  As you begin your journey through the site, you’ll be guided until you reach a certain level of competency. Once you have an avatar, you can begin the first narrative, which delves into the project charter and the technical setup behind this website. Both topics will offer opportunities to shape your avatar’s traits.

- **Locked Content**  
  I plan to share as much as possible with you throughout this course of discovery. However, there is a larger purpose behind this world’s creation. If I revealed it now, you likely wouldn’t believe me—and, in truth, I can only reveal it to those who demonstrate they’re prepared. Not everyone will unlock the entire site, but those who do will eventually join the simulation in full (though that’s a long way off yet).
